\title{
  Weather Task With Priming and Precise and Imprecise Probabilities 
}
\description{
  In this study participants were asked to judge how likely Sunday is to
  be the hottest day of the week.
}
\usage{data("WeatherTask", package = "betareg")}
\format{
  A data frame with 345 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{priming}}{a factor with levels \code{two-fold} (case
      prime) and \code{seven-fold} (class prime).}
    \item{\code{eliciting}}{a factor with levels \code{precise} and
      \code{imprecise} (lower and upper limit).}
    \item{\code{agreement}}{a numeric vector, probability indicated by
      participants or the average between minimum and maximum
      probability indicated.}
  }
}
\details{
  All participants in the study were either first- or second-year
  undergraduate students in psychology, none of whom had a strong
  background in probability or were familiar with imprecise probability
  theories. 
  
  For \code{priming} the questions were:
  \describe{
    \item{two-fold}{[What is the probability that] the temperature at
      Canberra airport on Sunday will be higher than every other day
      next week?}
    \item{seven-fold}{[What is the probability that] the highest
      temperature of the week at Canberra airport will occur on Sunday?}
  }
  For \code{eliciting} the instructions were if
  \describe{
    \item{precise}{to assign a probability estimate,}
    \item{imprecise}{to assign a lower and upper probability estimate.}
  }
}
