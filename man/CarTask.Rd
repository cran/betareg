\title{
  Partition-primed Probability Judgement Task for Car Dealership
}
\description{
  In this study participants were asked to judge how likely it is that a
  customer trades in a coupe or that a customer buys a car form a
  specific salesperson out of four possible salespersons.
}
\usage{data("CarTask", package = "betareg")}
\format{
  A data frame with 155 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{task}}{a factor with levels \code{Car} and
      \code{Salesperson} indicating the condition.}
    \item{\code{probability}}{a numeric vector of the estimated probability.}
    \item{\code{NFCCscale}}{a numeric vector of the NFCC scale.}
  }
}
\details{
  All participants in the study were undergraduate students at The
  Australian National University, some of whom obtained course credit in
  first-year Psychology for their participation in the study.

  The NFCC scale is a combined scale of the Need for Closure and Need
  for Certainty scales which are strongly correlated.
  
  For \code{task} the questions were:
  \describe{
    \item{Car}{What is the probability that a customer trades in a coupe?}
    \item{Salesperson}{What is the probability that a customer buys a
      car from Carlos?}
  }
