Description: Beta regression for modeling beta-distributed dependent variables, e.g., rates and proportions.
  In addition to maximum likelihood regression (for both mean and precision of a beta-distributed
  response), bias-corrected and bias-reduced estimation as well as finite mixture models and
  recursive partitioning for beta regressions are provided.
